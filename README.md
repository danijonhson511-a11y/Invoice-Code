## 🚀 Getting Started

You can use these components inside any **React** or **Next.js** project.

### 1. Clone or download

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Invoice-Code.git
cd Invoice-Code
```

### 2. Copy what you need

The main files live in the `Code/` directory.  
You can copy entire folders or import components individually:

```js
import InvoiceEdit from './Code/Components/Invoice/InvoiceEdit.jsx';
```

### 3. Run your app

If you’re integrating into an existing React project, just start your app as usual:

```bash
npm start
# or
npm run dev
```
